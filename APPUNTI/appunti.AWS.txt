       AWS PLATFORM:  1. Messaging
                      2. Security & Identity
                      3. Management Tools
                      4. Storage
                      5. Databases
                      6. Networking & Content Delivery
                      7. Compute
                      8. AWS Global Infrastructure: REGIONS / AVAILABILITY ZONES / EDGE LOCATIONS



             8. AWS Global Infrasructure:

                      REGION         = Geog. AREA of 2+ AVAILAB. ZONES
                      AVAILAB. ZONES = Data Center
                      EDGE LOC       = They CACHE the contet (i.e. a video from Australia
                                                              requested by a 1st user in NEW YORK
                                                              is actually transferred across.
                                                              A 2nd NEW YORK user will find it cahed)
                                       Said otherwise EDGE LOC are
                                       Content-Delivery-Network (CDN)  End Point for CloudFront    

                           . EDGE LOCs >> REGIONs
                           . Not all REGIONs have ALL the services
                                  
             6. Networking & Content Delivery: 
                                                . VPC: Virtual Private Cloud 
                                                  (think of it as a Virtual DATA CENTER)

                                                  They can be >1 in a REGION
 

                                                . Route53: Amazon DNS service
                                                           (nb. 53 is DNS standard port)

                                                . CloudFront: The Cache service made by many
                                                              EDGE locat.

                                                . Direct Connect: Connect my office to AWS
                                                              with a physical dedicated machine (and line)
                                                              (for security reason)

             7. Compute
                                                . EC2: they are the VM (like Virtualbox)
                                                       So think of EC2 as the service for Virtualization

                                                       It's implemented by Docker container called: 
                                                     - EC2 Container service

                                                     - Elastic Beanstalk: when passing to it any piece of code
                                                                          it provisions the required infranstructure
                                                                          to run the code

                                                     - Lambda: the flexible service behind all
