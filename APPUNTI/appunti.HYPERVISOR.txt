assgne os specific core : Xen / KVM / VMWare





Type-1: native or bare-metal hypervisors
          allocation of all resources (disk, memory, CPU, and peripherals) to its guests.
          do not, themselves, require extensive resources.

          Some also require a privileged guest virtual machine, known as a Domain-0 or Dom0, 
          to provide access to the management and control interface to the hypervisor itself.

Type-2: hosted hypervisors: require a full host operating system
          additional overhead can cause a hit on performance

Type-X: Linux's Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) 

-------------------------------------------
        1. Application Virtualization       a layer from the operating system making the applications 
                                            independent from the underlying operating system.

        2. Application streaming            Instead of running locally, either native or virtual, 
                                            applications are executed on servers enabling users to interface 
                                            via the internet.

        3. Virtual Desktop                  Similar to application streaming, virtual desktop allows for 
                                            the full desktop operating system to be virtualized

        4. Operating System Virtualization  multiple operating system instances to run simultaneously on 
                                            a single physical machine.

benefit of Virtualiz.

Migration:      Migration helps to reduce or eliminate downtime as the virtual machines can
                be moved temporarily or permanently to a different host transparent to the guest operating
                system.

IaaS            Infrastructure as a Service: 
                allows organizations to lease compute-power from 1 or + data centers and
                SCALE and reduce it usage as their situation requires.

-------------------------------------------
Xen:           - a specific privileged GUEST running on the hypervisor known as Domain-0 or Dom0
               - Domain-U (DomU) unprivileged virtual machine.
                           none of them have direct access to the hardware
               - paravirtualization (PV): required Originally, that DomU guests had a modified kernel 
                           ported specifically to run on Xen.
                           the guests are aware that they are running on a hypervisor.
               - "hypercalls": privileged kernel instructions, (memory and CPU management), are converted 
                           to ”hypercalls” and easily executed by the hypervisor.
               - HVM: Hardware Virtual Machine, now Xen allows, with HW with virtualization extensions
                      (Intel VT or AMD-V), to run unmodified DomU.

-------------------------------------------
KVM            Kernel-based Virtual Machine      incorporated into the upstream Linux 2.6.20
               a kernel module which, when loaded, converts the kernel into a bare metal hypervisor.
               was designed and implemented having Intel VT or AMD-V extensions, so avoiding to must implement
               a SW layer for that.
               each virtual machine is a standard Linux process.
               A modified version of QEMU is used to provide emulation for devices such as 
               BIOS, PCI bus, USB bus, disk controllers and network cards.

               supports copy-on-write image file format to manage Guest virtual disks

               (KSM) Kernel Samepage Merging:  works by merging identical memory pages from multiple 
               guests into a single read-only memory region removing duplicate copies.
               In the event one of the guests attempts to write to one of these pages,
               a writeable copy is created for that guest to modify.

-------------------------------------------
VirtIO:       VirtIO drivers are included in Linux kernels after 2.6.25 and are also available for 
              Microsoft Windows guests as well.
              VirtIO is a standard framework allowing guests to be more easily transferred between 
              hypervisor platforms supporting VirtIO. 
              This allows for increased I/O performance for network and block devices.
              KVM supports VirtIO.

-------------------------------------------
Redhat Enterprise Linux, RHEL 6, no longer supports running as a Xen dom0. 
              Instead Redhat has decided to migrate to KVM
