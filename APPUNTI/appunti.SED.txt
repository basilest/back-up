Alternation      a|b|c



     By default sed uses POSIX Basic Regular Expressions,
     which don't include | .

     OS X and GNU includes it but with different options

          -r     GNU
          -E     OS X

     echo 'cat dog pear banana cat dog' | sed -r    's/cat|dog/Bear/g'      GNU
     echo 'cat dog pear banana cat dog' | sed -E -e 's/cat|dog/Bear/g'      OS X



Grouping
           \( \)     to catch              in OS X is \{ \}
           \1        to use

          sed  's/^([A-Za-z]+-[0-9]+).*$/\1/'
