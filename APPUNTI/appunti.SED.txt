Alternation      a|b|c



     By default sed uses POSIX Basic Regular Expressions,
     which don't include | .

     OS X and GNU includes it but with different options

          -r     GNU
          -E     OS X

     echo 'cat dog pear banana cat dog' | sed -r    's/cat|dog/Bear/g'      GNU
     echo 'cat dog pear banana cat dog' | sed -E -e 's/cat|dog/Bear/g'      OS X



Grouping
           \( \)     to catch              in OS X is \{ \}
           \1        to use

          sed  's/^([A-Za-z]+-[0-9]+).*$/\1/'


Inserting a file
          '/aaaa/ r file.txt's

           ‚ùØ sed  -e '/id_rsa/ {                       <--- 1. when you find a line containing ir_rsa
                                 r patch.txt                2. source file patch.txt and print
                                 d ;}' a                    3. delete the line


           On most versions of sed (but not all), the 'r' (read) and 'w' (write) commands must be followed by EXACTLY 1 space,
           then the filename, and then terminated by a newline.
           Any additional characters before or after the filename are interpreted as part of the filename. Thus

                /RE/r  insert.me

           will try to locate a file called ' insert.me' (note the leading space!).
           If the file was not found, most versions of sed say nothing, not even an error message.

           When sed scripts are used on the command line, every 'r' and 'w' must be the last command in that part of the script. Thus,

                   sed -e '/regex/{r insert.file;d;}' source         # will fail
                   sed -e '/regex/{r insert.file' -e 'd;}' source    # will succeed
