------------------------------------------
      Asynchronous programming
------------------------------------------

 JavaScript is usually "single-threaded":

     Only one thing can happen at a time, on a single main thread,
     and everything else is blocked until an operation completes.


    Many Web API features now use asynchronous code to run, especially
    those that access some kind of resource
     - fetching a file from the network
     - accessing a database and returning data from it

    using synchronous code won't work, ex:

        let response = fetch('myImage.png');
        let blob = response.blob();
        // display your image blob in the UI somehow

    The problem is that I don't know how long the image will take to download,
    so when I come to run the second line it will throw an error (possibly intermittently, possibly every time)
    because the response is not yet available.
    Instead, I need my code to wait.

------------------------------------------
      Callbacks
------------------------------------------
A callback is a function passed as an argument to another function.

            ________________________________________
           |  function myDisplayer(some) {
           |    document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = some;
           |  }
           |
           |  function myCalculator(num1, num2, myCallback) {
           |    let sum = num1 + num2;
           |    myCallback(sum);
           |  }
           |
           |  myCalculator(5, 5, myDisplayer);    <----- passed just the name, no ()
           '________________________________________

the callback function is not executed immediately.
It is "called back" asynchronously somewhere inside
the containing function's body when the time comes.

Callbacks are then a first way to do Asynchronous programming
anyhow they are slightly old-fashioned now.

Promises are the new style of async code.
A good example is the fetch() API, which is basically like a modern,
more efficient version of XMLHttpRequest.
------------------------------------------
      Promise     "I Promise a Result!"
------------------------------------------


          "Producing code" is code that can take some time
          "Consuming code" is code that must wait for the result

          A Promise is a JavaScript object that
          contains both the producing code and calls to the consuming code:

          A promise will return a value in the future, which means
          it lets asynchronous methods to return values like synchronous methods:
          instead of immediately returning the final value, the asynchronous method
          returns a promise to supply the value at some point in the future.

          IMPORTANT: when working with the promises think that by default things are going async
                     instead of normally sync. Be careful then because you can find that
                     for example a DB connection has been closed before you even started reading from it.

  --------------
   3 states
  --------------
           A promise internally can be in any of 3 possible state:

           settled / -fulfilled  (resolve() was called)
           ------- \ -rejected   (reject()  was called)

                     -pending    (not yet fulfilled & rejected)

            people use
                      resolved or
                      settled
            to mean "not pending"

            - Once settled, a promise can not be resettled.
              Calling resolve() or reject() again will have no effect.
              The immutability of a settled promise is an important feature.


            - JavaScript don't expose promise states.
              promise are considered as a black box.

  --------------
   Promises versus callbacks
  --------------

Promises have some similarities to old-style callbacks.
They are essentially a returned object to which you attach callback functions,
rather than having to pass callbacks into a function.

However, promises are specifically made for handling async operations,
and have many advantages over old-style callbacks:

  . You can chain multiple async operations together using multiple .then() operations,
    passing the result of one into the next one as an input.
    This is much harder to do with callbacks, which often ends up with a messy "pyramid of doom" (or callback hell).

  . Promise callbacks are always called in the strict order they are placed in the event queue.

  . Error handling is much better - all errors are handled by a single .catch() block at the end,
    rather than being individually handled in each level of the "pyramid".

  . Promises avoid inversion of control, unlike old-style callbacks, which lose full control of how
    the function will be executed when passing a callback to a third-party library.


  --------------
    Promise guarantes next block will be called
  --------------

   Generally, you are less interested in the amount of time an async operation will take to return its result
   (unless of course, it takes far too long!),
   and more interested in being able to respond to it being returned, whenever that is.
   And of course, it's nice that it doesn't block the rest of the code execution.

  --------------
    Create = Exec
  --------------

   Per the promise spec, as soon as a promise is created, it begins executing.

   Be careful then, because
   if for example I create an array of Promises thinking to run them sequentially,
   this will not exec as I'm assuming, as once the Promises are created they start executing.

  --------------
   4 static methods
  --------------

            There are 4 class-methods (which can be called on type JS 'Promise' without an object)
                Promise.resolve()
                Promise.reject()
                Promise.all()
                Promise.race()

    Promise.resolve('some')  <----------- here Promise.resolve  will resolve directly passing 'some' to the chain (.then)

          .then(function(string) { // <-- This will happen after the above Promise resolves (returning the value 'some')
            return new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
              setTimeout(function() {
                string += 'thing';
                resolve(string);
              }, 1);
            });
          })
          .then(function(string) { // <-- This will happen after the above .then's new Promise resolves
            console.log(string); // <-- Logs 'something' to the console
          });


    Promise.all()   the syntax is

            Promise.all([a, b, c]).then(values => {
              ...
            });

    It receives an array of Promises. The .then will be executed if ALL are fulfilled
    and the 'values' passed as arg is an array of the values returned by each.
    If any Promise fails, the then is not executed.

        let a = fetch(url1);
        let b = fetch(url2);
        let c = fetch(url3);

        Promise.all([a, b, c]).then(values => {
          ...
        });
    ------------------------------------------
      async / await
------------------------------------------
sync way:
     function hello() { return "Hello" };
     hello();     # Hello

async way:
     async function hello() { return "Hello" };
     hello();     # Promise { <state>: "fulfilled", <value>: "Hello" }  <--- returns a Promise

I can assign to a var:
     hello = async function() { return "Hello" };
     hello();     # Promise { <state>: "fulfilled", <value>: "Hello" }

I can use arrow functions:
     hello = async () => { return "Hello" };
     hello();     # Promise { <state>: "fulfilled", <value>: "Hello" }

To actually consume the value I can use a .then() block:
     hello().then((value) => console.log(value))
     # or just
     # hello().then(console.log)




await:


       await can be put in front of any async promise-based function
       to pause on that line until the promise fulfills, then return the resulting value.

       The await keyword causes the JavaScript runtime to pause your code on this line,
       not allowing further code to execute in the meantime until the async function call has returned its result
       — very useful if subsequent code relies on that result!


------------------------------------------
      promises
------------------------------------------
- Callbacks added with then() even after the success or failure of the asynchronous operation, will be called.


the then() function returns a new promise, different from the original

----------------- fat arrow

 =>   for   function:

      function(a,b) { ... }    (a,b) => { ... }


 x    for   return x:

      () => { return x; }          () => x


----------------- async
The word "async" before a function means one simple thing:
a function always returns a promise. (and wraps non-promises in it.)

async function f() {
  return 1;
}

short for:

async function f() {
  return Promise.resolve(1);
}


I call as usual.
ex.
    f().then(alert); // 1


----------------- await

await  works only inside async functions.


The keyword await makes JavaScript wait until that promise settles and returns its result.
(It’s just a more elegant syntax of getting the promise result than promise.then, easier to read and write.)


let value = await promise;       // value contains the result of the promise.





async function f() {

  let promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    setTimeout(() => resolve("done!"), 1000)
  });

  let result = await promise; // wait until the promise resolves

  alert(result); // "done!"
}

f();


--------- wrap code
People who are just starting to use await tend to forget the fact that we can’t use await in top-level code. For example, this will not work:

let response = await fetch('/article/promise-chaining/user.json');
let user = await response.json();


fix:  wrap it into an anonymous async function:

(async () => {
  let response = await fetch('/article/promise-chaining/user.json');
  let user = await response.json();
  ...
})();

.JavaScript  the behavior.    (with the advent of Node (http://nodejs.org),

                                            .last command before }

-primitive types:
                N.B. JavaScript converts from one type to another.
                     (ex. a function expects a string, and you give it a number: it's converted into a string)

-untyped:       you can assign a value of any type to a variable, and you can later assign another
                J. performs automatic conversion. To perform an explicit conversion the simplest way is to
                use the Boolean()   Number()   String()   Object() functions:
                         Number("3")   //  3
                         String(false) //  "false" Or false.toString()
                         Boolean([])   //  true
                         Object(3)     //  new Number(3)

-declare:       Variables are declared with 'var':    (you should always declare your variables with var!!)
                          var i, sum;                    <--- this var has value 'undefined'
                          var i = 0, j = 0, k = 0;

                          for(var i = 0, j=10; i < 10; i++,j--) console.log(i*j); <--- Note inside a 'for'

-scope:         In C-like each block of code {} has its own scope, (var are not visible outside)
                This is called block scope.
                JavaScript instead, uses function scope:
                var are visible in the fun where defined and in any nested fun in that function.


-numbers:       There are no int. All numbers are float 64.bit
                - hexadecimal:   0xff      0X1CA
                - exponential:   6.02e23   1.47E-32
                - Infinity -Infinity     (produced ex when dividing for 0. It's not an exception in Javascript)
                - 0/0 generates a Javscript exception  (indicated by 'NaN')

-Strings:       - array of 16.bit Unicode Char starting from pos.0 to len-1
                  char must be accessed by s.charAt(). In ECMAScript 5 also as s[0]  or s[s.length-1]
                - Delimit them with both "" or ''
                - s.length  to have the len
                - '+' to concatenate:   msg = "Hello, " + "world";
                - usual escape   \n \t \\

                  var s = "hello, world"
                  s.charAt(0)                   => "h": the first character.
                  s.charAt(s.length-1)          => "d": the last character.
                  s.substring(1,4)              => "ell": chars 2, 3, and 4
                  s.slice(1,4)                  => "ell": same thing
                  s.slice(-3)                   => "rld": last 3 characters
                  s.indexOf("l")                => 2: position of first l.
                  s.lastIndexOf("l")            => 10: position of last l.
                  s.indexOf("l", 3)             => 3: position at or after 3
                  s.split(", ")                 => ["hello", "world"]
                  s.replace("h", "H")           => "Hello, world":
                  s.toUpperCase()               => "HELLO, WORL"

                  Note that any value other than 'null' or 'undefined' has a
                                 toString() method
                  and the result of this method is usually the same as that returned by the
                                 String() function

-'+':             + gives priority to string concatenation: if either of the operands are strings
                    (or an object that converts to a string), the other operand is converted to a string and
                    concatenation is performed. Addition is performed only if neither operand is string-like.

-Boolean:         'true' 'false'  a == 4
                  As J. is untyped, following value used in Boolean comparison means 'false'
                           / undefined
                           | null
                    false  | 0
                           | -0
                           | NaN
                           \ "" // the empty string

-null / undefined:    - null:  to use when numbers.strings.objects have no value
                               is a keyword
                               typeof(null) returns the String 'object'
                      - undefined: is a J. global variable (not a keyword)
                               is the value of var never initialized
                               the return value of fucntions which have no return
                               the value of var that not exist (field of an object, or par of a function)
                      Despite these differences, null and undefined both indicate an absence of value
                      and can often be used interchangeably. The equality operator == considers them to be equal (and 'false')
                     (Use the strict equality operator === to distinguish them.)

                     Note: In the strict mode of ECMAScript 5, a nonexistent variable throws a ReferenceError

                     Note the result here:

                         x + "" // Same as String(x)
                         +x     // Same as Number(x). Also x-0
                         !!x    // Same as Boolean(x). NB: double !

-eval()              Like any interpreted language also javascript has the 'eval()'
                     eval() expects one argument. If its is a:
                      . value it simply returns that value.
                      . string, it attempts to parse the string as JavaScript code  # ex. eval("3+2")
                         throwing a SyntaxError if it fails to parses the string

                     It has the scope of the functions that call it (so can see that fun local var), but can be
                     overwritten with possible code snippetes like the following

                         eval("var y = 3;")      # var y would hide any other local var y
                         eval("function f() { return x+1; }");   # defines on the fly an inner function

-The Global Object:  A J. program when started has a Global Object (like a unix environment) instantiated. Any
                     user global var is a field of the Global Object. You can refer in any time to the Global Object
                     (and to its fields) with the usual keyword 'this'.

-array:              [] // An empty array
                     [1+2,3+4]
                     var matrix = [[1,2,3], [4,5,6], [7,8,9]];


-Object:             Like array but use  {} instead:
                     var q = {};              // Empty object; no properties
                     var p = { x:2, y:1 };    // An object with 2 properties
                     q.x = 2; q.y = 1;        // Now q has the same prop as p

                     var rectangle = { upperLeft:  { x: 2, y: 2 },
                                       lowerRight: { x: 4, y: 5 } };

                     property names may be quoted strings (this is useful to use names that are reserved words)
                     var square = { "ul": { x: p.x, y: p.y },
                                    'lr': { x: p.x + side, y: p.y + side}};

                     Moreover property can be accessed with 2 notations:
                         object . prop
                         object [prop]
                     The [] form is useful when the property name is a reserved word or includes spaces or special cahr.

                     Object Creation:  new Point(2,3)
                                       new Object()      If no arguments are passed the empty pair of parentheses can
                                                         be omitted: new Object     new Date
                     in: returns 'true' if that object-var has a property which that name:
                         var p = { x:1, y:1 };
                             "x" in p            //  true: p has a property named "x".
                             "z" in p            //  false: p has no "z" property.
                             "toString" in p     //  true: p inherits toString.
                         var a = [7,8,9];
                             "0" in a            //  true: a has an element "0"
                             1 in a              //  true: numbers are converted

                     Instead of using the in operator, it is (sometimes)  sufficient the !==

                              var o = { x: 1 }
                              o.x !== undefined;     true
                              o.y !== undefined;     false

                     this doesn't work if property exists but have been set to undefined
                             var o = { x: undefined }
                             o.x !== undefined    false
                             "x" in o             true



                     instanceof:
                         var d = new Date();
                             d instanceof Date;        //  true
                             d instanceof Object;      //  true
                             d instanceof Number;      //  false
                         var a = [1, 2, 3];
                             a instanceof Array;       //  true
                             a instanceof Object;      //  true


Strict equality ( === )   If both operands have different types                              --> false
                          If both operands are primitive types and their values are the same --> true
                          If both operands refer to the same object, array, or function      --> true
                          If they refer to different objects
                             even if both objects have identical properties                  --> false
                         two arrays that have the same elements in the same order            --> false
                         NaN not equal to any other value, including itself!

Strict inequality ( !== ) is the exact opposite of the ===

Loose equality ( == )    If the values of the two operands are not the same type,
                         it attempts conversions and tries again.
                         null ==  undefined  --> true
                                                                 1     == "1"  \
                                                                 true  == 1     |
                                                                 "1"   == true  | <-- all true
                                                                 false == 0     |
                                                                 []    == 0    /

&&  ||:     As J. can interpret any type for boolean (according to type conversion) && and || have
            deep meaning in J. The rules are:
                1. As soon as a result can be returned the interpretation is stopped
                   (so following operands of && || are not considered) - short circuit as C & Perl
                2. The return value is the operands that make the interpretation stopped

                   var o = { x : 1 };
                   var p = null;
                   o && o.x // returns 1: o is truthy, so return o.x
                   p && p.x // returns null: p is falsy, so don't eval p.x which is evaluated would have throws an TypeError

                   var max = max_width || preferences.max_width || 500;    often used to supply default values

                   function copy(o, p) {
                                        p = p || {};               // If no object passed for p, use a new one

for/in        a form of iteration usefull when iteration the properties of an object:
                      for(var p in o)
                           console.log(o[p]); // Print each property

              The ECMAScript specification does not describe the order in which the loop
              enumerates the properties of an object.
              In practice, JavaScript implementations from all major browser
              enumerate  the properties of simple objects in the order in which they were defined

throw         The syntax is:    throw expression;        expression may be a value of any type:

                                          - a number (that represents an error code)
                                          - a string (that contains a human-readable error message).
                                          - an Error() object: used by J. but you can use them as well. Has:

                   // sometimes throw an exception, either directly, with   |     var f = factorial(n);
                   // a throw statement, or indirectly, by calling a        |     alert(n + "! = " + f);
                   // method that throws an exception.                      |}
                   }                                                        |
                   catch (e) {                                              |
                   // The statements in this block are executed if, and     |  catch (ex) {
                   // only if, the try block throws an exception. These     |           alert(ex);
                   // statements can use the local variable e to refer      |  }
                   // to the Error object or other value that was thrown.   |
                   // This block may handle the exception somehow, may      |
                   // ignore the exception by doing nothing, or may         |
                   // rethrow the exception with throw.                     |
                   }                                                        |
                   finally {                                                |
                   // This block contains statements that are always        |
                   // executed, regardless of what happens in the try       |
                   // block.                                                |
                   }                                                        |



--------------------------------------------------------------- OBJECS
                          Objects are manipulated by reference rather than by value:
                          var y = x; y holds a reference to x, not a copy.
                          Any modifications through y modifies also x

create:      1.   use the syntax { name_field : value }

                     var empty = {};           // An object with no properties
                     var point = { x:0, y:0 }; // Two properties
                     var point2 = {
                                    x:point.x,
                                    y:point.y+1
                                };
                     var book = {                                 // property names are quoted
                                    "main title": "JavaScript",   // space in property name
                                    'sub-title': "Pocket Ref",    // punctuation in name
                                    "for": "all audiences",       // reserved word name


             2.  use new      (in ECMAScript 5) with the Object.create()

                 var o  =  new  Object();        // An empty object: same as {}.
                 var a  =  new  Array();         // An empty array: same as [].
                 var d  =  new  Date();          // A Date for the current time.
                 var r  =  new  RegExp("js");    // A pattern matching object.

             4.  prototype:  It's like a 'father class for an object.
                             any object has a 'Object.prototype' object behind
                             primitive types most often has this: Object.prototype
                             but they can have others (ex. Date as both Date.prototype
                             and Object.prototype) so there can be 'chains' of
                             prototypes associated to an object

                             So it's like javascript has a multiple inheritance.

                             using the following 3-steps core code I can make an
                             'inheritance' function:

                             1. function f() {};
                             2. f.prototype = p;
                             3. return new f()

                          function inherit(p) {
                             if (p == null) // p must be a non-null
                                  throw TypeError();
                             if (Object.create)              // Use Object.create()
                                  return Object.create(p);   // if it is defined.
                             var t = typeof p;               // Make sure p is an object
                                  if (t !== "object" && t !== "function")
                             throw TypeError();

                             function f() {};           // Define a dummy constructor.
                             f.prototype = p;           // Set its prototype property
                             return new f();            // Use it to create an "heir" of p.
                          }

             3.  (ECMAScript 5)  create()
                             Object.create() is a static function. The args are:
                             1st: the list of prototypes I want to associate to that object.
                             2nd (optional)  the same type as specified in  Object.defineProperties()
                                             after in these notes.

                             new Object()  is equivalent to   Object.create(Object.prototype)

             4.  fields (or properties)
                             when I write o.x  J goes through all the chain of prototypes
                             to serach for field 'x' if it's not present directly in 'o'.


                                 var o = {}           // o inherits object methods from Object.prototype (ex. toString()
                                 o.x = 1;             // and has an own property x.
                 see above f <-- var p = inherit(o);  // p inherits properties from o and Object.prototype
                                 p.y = 2;             // and has an own property y.

                                 var q = inherit(p);   // q inherits properties
                                 q.z = 3;              // and has an own property z.
                                 var s = q.toString(); // toString is inherited from Object.prototype
                                 q.x + q.y             // x and y are inherited form o, p


             5.  hasOwnProperty()
                                we've already seen the 'in' fun to return true if an Object
                                has that prop. Other fun are
                                o.hasOwnProperty("x");      true if o has x directly not inheritated!
                                o.propertyIsEnumerable("x")  more strict. It's like hasOwnProperty()
                                                             but true also if 'x' is 'enumerable'
                                                             Properties created by normal
                                                             JavaScript code are enumerable.
                                                             Certain built-in
                                                             properties are not enumerable:
                                                             toString method is not enumerable
                                function extend(o, p) {
                                         for(prop in p) {  // go through all the (enumerable) prop of p
                                         o[prop] = p[prop]; // Add the property to o.
                                         }
                                         return o;
                                } // this function add to o all the prop of p
                                     o mantains what it had before

                               Instead of for (prop in p) to go through all the enumerable prop
                               there are 2 functions to get the names:

                               Object.keys()   returns an array of the names of the enumerable own prop
                               Object.getOwnPropertyNames()  (ECMAScript 5) ALL (not just the enumerable)



--------------------------------------------------------------- Serialization

JSON.stringify()         to have a string from an object    s = JSON.stringify(o);
JSON.parse()             to reread back an build an object  p = JSON.parse(s);

JSON stands for “JavaScript Object Notation,”
--------------------------------------------------------------- GETTER / SETTER

the sugar syntax is used the keyword 'get' and 'set' and a comma after the fun definition:

      var p = {
                x: 1.0,
                y: 1.0,
                get r() {
                     return ...
                },             <--- comma
                set r( ...) {
                     this.x *= ...
                     this.y *= ...
                },             <--- comma

--------------------------------------------------------------- Property Attributes
            each field of an object has 4 properties:

                                             value
                                             writable
                                             enumerable
                                             configurable

            they are conatined in what (ECMAScript 5) calls a 'property descriptor'

         -  to get this 'property descriptor' there is the fun Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor()
            ex. for the above p is
            Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(p, "x");  --> Returns {value: 1.0, writable:true,
                                                                   enumerable:true, configurable:true}

         -  it's possible to create or modify fields and their prop through the fun
            Object.defineProperty():

            var o = {}; // Start with no properties at all

            Object.defineProperty(o, "x", { value : 1,  // Add a nonenumerable x with value 1.
                                            writable: true,
                                            enumerable: false,
                                            configurable: true});

                                // Check that the property is there but is nonenumerable
            o.x;                // => 1
            Object.keys(o)      // => []
                                // Now modify the property x so that it is read-only
            Object.defineProperty(o, "x", { writable: false });
                                // Try to change the value of the property
            o.x = 2;            // Fails silently or TypeError in strict mode
            o.x                 // => 1
                                // The property is still configurable, so we can change its value like this:
            Object.defineProperty(o, "x", { value: 2 });
            o.x                 // => 2
                                // Now change x to an accessor property
            Object.defineProperty(o, "x", {
                                            get: function() { return 0; }
                                            });
            o.x                 // => 0


    If you want to create or modify more than one property at a time, use
                          Object.defineProperties() .
    1st argument is the object that is to be modified.
    2nd argument is an object that maps the names of the properties to be created or modified

    For example:
    var p = Object.defineProperties({}, {
                                          x: { value: 1, writable: true,
                                          enumerable:true, configurable:true },
                                          y: { value: 1, writable: true,
                                          enumerable:true, configurable:true },
                                          r: {
                                          get: function() {
                                          return Math.sqrt(this.x*this.x+this.y*this.y)
                                          },
                                          enumerable:true,
                                          configurable:true
                                          }
                                          });

--------------------------------------------------------------- Object Attributes

          Every object has associated 3 attributes
                                                    prototype,
                                                    class,
                                                    extensible

          prototype: we have seen that each object has behind a prototype obj. It is
                     1.  Object.prototype   when the obj is created
                                            literally:    var point = { x:0, y:0 };

                     2.  Date.prototype  (for ex)   when the obj is created
                                                    with a new():     var d = Date();

                     3. any obj spec. as 1st arg when the obj is created
                                                 with a create()      var o = Object.create(p);

                     Object.getPrototypeOf() : return the prototype chain of 1 obj
                     p.isPrototypeOf(o):  returns 'true' if p is prototype of o

                     var p = {x:1};
                     var o = Object.create(p);         // Inherit from p (prototype).
                     p.isPrototypeOf(o)                // true.
                     Object.prototype.isPrototypeOf(p) // true for any object.

          class: it should be the string name of the Class of any obj.
                     ECMA standard does not specify well. There are tricky ways which
                     rely on to String;

                     function classof(o) {
                              if (o === null) return "Null";
                              if (o === undefined) return "Undefined";
                              return Object.prototype.toString.call(o).slice(8,-1);
                     }

          extensible: allow or avoid an object can be modified/ extended in the future.
                     There is a set of functions.
                     nb. there is no way to undo their effects
                                Object.preventExtensions() :     avoid future mods
                                Object.seal()              :     more strict
                                Object.freeze()            :     even more strict

                                Object.isExtensible()
                                Object.isSealed()
                                Object.isFrozen()
--------------------------------------------------------------- Classes

    J Classes are different from standard C++/Java OO (strongly-typed)

    The prototype object, is the central feature of a class:
    "a class is a set of objects that inherit properties
     from the same prototype obj"

    Thus, if we define a prototype object, and then use Object.create()
    to create objects that inherit from it, we have defined a JavaScript class.











--------------------------------------------------------------- DOM

   Content of a Web page = Document Object (DO). It's the central object
   of a larger model (DOM: (Document Object Model)) that is a set of API
   around DO.

tree:   the HTML / XMTL docs are modelled as a 'hierarchy tree', where
        the 'NODES' are both
              the '<tag>s'   (called ELEMENTS-nodes)    (1)
              the text 'String' representing some values (called TEXT-nodes) (2)
        The 'root' of the tree is the 'DOCUMENT'-node (3)

        1-2-3 are the 3 type of nodes in the tree

        The most general above terminology in the specific case of HTML can use
        the names DOCUMENT <--> HTMLDocument  ELEMENT <--> HTMLElement

Javascript:  provides a lot of functions to manipulate the node of the tree
        The first set of API is to 'SELECT' the proper node
        There are different ways to select:
            1. by 'id'
            2. by 'name'
            3. by 'tag'
            4. by CSS class/ classes
            5. by CSS selector

    ----------------- 1. by id

     'id' is the 'attrib' of a HTML tag.
     Each HTML Elem has its own, and any value is different from the others.

     - getElementByyyId()    var sect1 = document.getElementById("section1");

    ----------------- 2. by name

    'name' is not unique like 'id'. It's usually present in some <tag>
    usually in the form, with user/ passw/ radiobutton/ checkbox/ ...


     - getElementsByName()      var btns = document.getElementsByName("color");

                                as 'name' can be not unique in the 'document'
                                the fun can return 1 entry or a list of all the
                                nodes (with that 'name')   (the list is of type 'NodeList')
                                If it's only 1 in all the doc, can be directly accessed:

                     var form = document.shipping_address; // Get the object for <form name="shipping_address">
                                        ^  ^^^^^^^^^^^^
    ----------------- 3. by tag

    ex get all the nodes for a specific <tag>  (ex <span>)

     - getElementsByTagName()             var spans = document.getElementsByTagName("span");
                                          It returns a list (ordered like they are in the doc).
                                          to get the 1st:
                                          var a = document.getElementsByTagName("p")[0]
     '*'           to get all the tags: getElementsByTagName("*")

     The list can be of type 'NodeList' or also for some tag of type 'HTMLCollections'.
     (<img> <form>  <a>). Anyhow they works with the same functions.  These lists are
     read-only.
                            // Loop through all images and hide them
                            for(var i = 0; i < document.images.length; i++)
                            document.images[i].style.display = "none";

   (Apache) Subversion [SVN]

   2000 created by CollabNet to replace CVS
   2009 accepted in (Apache) Incubator
        Apache Incubator is the gateway for open-source projects
        intended to become fully fledged Apache Software Foundation projects.


   2016: ver 1.9


   Repository : SNC calls them 'filesystem'

   Repository type: FSFS "FileSystem atop the FileSystem" is since 2004
                    the new format replacing the 2000 original 'Berkley DB'
                    It stores the FSF repo structure, the 'filesystem'
                    as a file in the normal Linux filesystem

   Accesses:        To access the repo, there are 3 protocols:
                       . file:///....    access the filesystem local or network)
                       . http[s]://      using inside Apache 2 the module (mod_dav_svn)  (WebDAV)
                       . svn://          custom protocol over TCP (port 3690)
                                         it becomes 'svn+ssh://' when tunneling over ssh

   Architecure:    is built as a stack of layers:
                       . FS     : lowest level, is the versioned filesystem
                       . Repos    wrapper araound the bare Filesystem (FS)
                                  it's a set of scripts that run on some events
                                  FS + Repos constitute  the 'filesystem interface'
                       . mod_dav_svn  implements the http[s] protocol interface
                       . RA       Repos Access, implements the other accesses (protocols: file, & svn)
                       . Client:  the most abstract level to manage high level client tasks (authentication, ...)

   Revisions:     a filesystem_path + number

   Transactions  operations on the Repo are
                   - atomic operations on revisions (any, not necessarily the last)
                   - done as a series of these atomic steps (transactions).

   Properties    are text pairs 'name=value' that user can add with no limit
                 to any node of the tree.
                 Some built in properties are available.
                 They have tha form: 'svn:xxxxxxx'=value (so a 'name' starting with 'svn:')
                 ex: svn:executable=....
                     svn:ignore=....
                     svn:eol-style=....

                 Properties are themself versioned.

   Rename        are implemented as 'copy + delete'
