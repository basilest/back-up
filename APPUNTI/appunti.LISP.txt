     Lisp:
           - efficient on SYMBOL manipulation
           - less efficient (than Fortran or C) on NUMERICAL manipulation
             even if improvements have been done on the compilers
             that translate Lisp code into machine code.
           - LISt Processor, where a LISt is represented in the common notation ( )
              functions are themselves written as lists,
              they can be processed exactly like data

     data objects:
                  -atom       are numbers or strings
                  -list       a finite series of atoms or lists
                              it must be thought as a linked list:

                                 ----------.     ----------.     ----------.
                                 | .  | .--|-->  | .  | .--|-->  | .  | .--|-->
                                 --|-------.     --|-------.     --|-------.
                                   |               |               |
                                  45               6              abc

                               ----------.
                               | .  | .--|-->        <-- this is called 'cons'
                               --|-------.               (in Scheme 'pair')
                                 |                       the pointer to the value is 'car'
                                                         the pointer to the next 'cons' is 'cdr'

                              a cons can be written in the dotted notation (a . b)
                              to highligth 'car' and 'cdr' but is never used as
                              (a b c)  would be less readable in this format (a . (b . (c nil)))

                              cons, is the function to insert an element as 1st in a list
                              (cons 1 '(2 3))  -->    (1 2 3)

           - 1958 (MIT) implemneted on an IBM 704, with assembly macros
             to manipulate list.
             2 of these macros were:

                'car' gives the 1' el of the list  (Contents of the Address   part of Register number)
                'cdr' gives the rest  of the list  (Contents of the Decrement part of Register number)

           - 1962  (MIT) 1' compiler
           - 1975  (MIT) implements Scheme      (minimal LISP, defines a subset of LISP spec)
           - 1984  'Common Lisp the Language' an influential book by Guy Steele to get rid of too many LISP dialects
           - 1994  ANSI standard of Common LISP (defines the Full LISP spec)
           - 1998  IEEE standard of Scheme (version R5RS)
           - 2007  IEEE standard of Scheme (version R6RS)

     pretty-printing:
                  -align and indent operators:
                        (+ (* 2 4)
                           (+ 3 5))

     read-eval-print loop   (REPL)
                            the mechanism can be synthesized in LISP notation
                            (loop (print (eval (read))))

     expression-oriented language:
                                   - code and data are written as EXPRESSIONS.
                                     (called S-expression   S for Symbolic)
                                   - an expression evaluated, produces a VALUE
                                     (in Common Lisp, possibly MULTIPLE values),
                                   - that value can so be EMBEDDED into other expressions.
                                   - in Common Lisp, evaluation is ('leftmost innermost'),
                                     in Scheme is undefined, leaving room for optimization by a compiler.


     (1 2 foo)           list with 3 atoms
     ()                  empty list
     nil                 syntax sugar for ()
                         so nil is at he same time an atom and a list
     (quote foo)         also ('foo)
                         returns without evaluating
                         (so literally foo)
                         without the ', LISP searches for a var foo to get its value
                         with compile error if foo is missing.
     (incf x)            x++
     (defun ..)          defines a function. Ex:
                         (defun foo (a b) (+ a b))
                         function return value: is the value of the last expression
     (list ..            returns a list. Ex
                         (list 1 '(2 3) 4)  --> (1 (2 3) 4)
     (cons ..            add an elem as 1'
     (append ..          add as last    (append '(1 2 3) '() '(a) '(5 6))  -->  (1 2 3 a 5 6)
     (push   ..          add as last    (push a 5)   add 5 to var a
     (reverse ..         (reverse '(1 2 3)) --> (3 2 1)
     (mapcar ..          takes as args
                               - function
                               - some lists (each of the same len N)
                         executes the function N times, each time with the i-th args from the lists
                         Ex: (mapcar #'+ '(1 2 3 4 5) '(10 20 30 40 50)) --> (11 22 33 44 55)


     format:             is the Lisp printf
                         (format t ".....")      t: standard output (terminal)
                         Ex. (defun hello-world () (format t "hello, world"))


     a program:          1. write code in a file .list or .cl  (ex. test1.lisp)
                         2. load that file: (load "test1.lisp") <-- NB the " "
                            the load read and executes each line of the file
                         3. another way is to first compile the file and load the result
                            (load (compile-file "test1.lisp"))
                                         ^
                                         this will create a test1.fasl               ^

     simple HASH         are lists where the keys have a ':' in front:
                         (list :a 1 :b 2 :c 3)

                         the (getf ... returns the value of a certain key
                         (getf (list :a 1 :b 2 :c 3) :a)   --> 1

     global var          (defvar *db* nil)        (defvar ...
                                                  *..*   is the naming convention

     (dolist             (dolist (cd *db*)
                                (format t "岷卑酤狺%" cd)))

                                                     is the % in C
                                            %        is the new line
                                                iterates on a list
                                            10t       add enough spaces till col 10
