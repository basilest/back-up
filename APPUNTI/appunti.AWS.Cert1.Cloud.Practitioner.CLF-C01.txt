                                                                              -  on-premises (also called Private cloud deployment)
                                                                                                          ^^^^^^^^^^^^^
                                                                                                  . Deploy resources by using virtualization and resource management tools.

                                                                              4  Benefit from massive economies of scale               the function "Costs (num_of_resources)" goes up more smoothly than if I own the resources
                                                                              5  Increases speed & agility                             I can experiment & innovate (deploying in minutes new architectures)
                                                                              6  Go Global in minutes                                  I can deploy in minutes worldwide (still low latency regardless of where my customers are)

                                                                              - buisness factors to choose a region:

                                                                                            3 Feature availability: some AWS features are not available in all REGIONS (ex. Quantum computing HW)

                                                     AVAILABILITY ZONES
                                                                              - They are inside of a REGION (at least 2 per REGION)

                                                                              - they are tens of miles apart to reduce disasters happening on 1, but they are close enough to reduce network latency between each other.

                                                     AVAILABILTY for my application: to have my application with high availability, means that I must run 2 EC2 (in 2 different AZ)

Module 4: Networking

                                                     AWS Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)
                                                                              I can launch AWS resources in a virtual network that I define.
                                                                              These resources can be:
                                                                                      . public facing so they have access to the internet                  |<---- known as subnets and
                                                                                      . private with no internet access  (backend services/ databases)     |      they are ranges of IPs

                                                     Gateways

                                                                                      . Internet Gateway:         it allows public traffic to enter my VPC (actually maybe only 1 subnet where there is the ELB)
                                                                                      . Virtual private Gateway:  it allows only private traffic (discarding public traffic). In the end they are the endpoints of my VPN
                                                                                                                  allowing private traffic on the open/public internet

                                                                              As sson as the EC2 is stopped or terminated these data are lost/deleted

                                                     Elastic Block Store (EBS)

                                                                              - they are at AZ level only (my EC2 must be in the same AZ. They are not at REGIONAL level like S3)
                                                                              - They offer the functionality of Hard Disks (block storage), so I can operate on the blocks of a file without uploading/change/downloading to disk the whole file
                                                                                ex. I have a 8GB video file that I'm editing and I edit 1 scene, the only blocks affected are written/modified on EBS.
                                                                              - They are SSD

                                                                                       . Type
                                                                                       . Size <-------------- they cannot be scale up/down. If I create 1 EBS of 2TB, that's it, I cannot scale it up later.
                                                                                       . Configuration

                                                     EBS snapshot
                                                                              they are INCREMENTAL backup of the data in 1 EBS.

                                                                                     . IAM users:                By default, when I create a new IAM user, it has NO permissions at all associated with it.

                                                                                                              Grouping together I have: 14TB/month > 10TB/month --> discounted price per TB can be applied
                                                                                                              the discount price will be applied for all the 3 accounts, with the 3rd having the
