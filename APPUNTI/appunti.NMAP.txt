        PORT SCANNER (3-way TCP handshake):

     1. checks if a PORT is open
        determining whether or not a TCP 3-way handshake can be established.

                            |     SYN      |
                         1) |----------->  |
                            |   SYN / ACK  |
                            |  <-----------|  2)
                            |     ACK      |
                         3) |---------->   |
                            |              |

        N.B. the above occurs for every port
             (usually not 65.535, but at least the most common: ~ 1000)

     2. determines which SERVICE is running on that (open) port
        ex. a web admin has configured the HTTP (web server)
            on port 12.345 instead of 80
