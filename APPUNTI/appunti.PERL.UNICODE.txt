            perl brings inside UTF8 byte streams from the outside world into internal data structures
            (ex. a get from URL)
                          ex. 1   $foo  = decode('UTF-8', get 'http://example.com/');

            perl can export its internal data structures out to the world as a UTF8 byte sequence
                          ex. 2   $body = encode('UTF-8', $body);

                  . 2 coordinated standars:
                           - Unicode
                           - ISO/IEC 10646

                  . Unicode 1.0 was released in October 1991
                  . Unicode 6.0 in October 2010


                  . A Unicode "character" is an abstract entity.
                    It is not bound to any particular integer width.
                    (ex. not 2 bytes (16 bits))

   CODE POINTS:

                  . Examples:
                           LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A    <----> unique number:  0x0041      unique numbers  are called 'CODE POINTS'
                           GREEK SMALL LETTER ALPHA  <----> unique number:  0x03B1

                    Unicode standard writes the 2 info together

                             U+0041 LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A

                  . 'CODE POINTS' are the index in the Unicode full list
                    (so Perl calls them even ORDINALS)

   PLANES         The first Unicode thought all the world's characters could be represented using 16-bit. (0x0000 - 0xFFFF)  (Plane 0)
                  This soon proved to be wrong.

                  Unicode 2.0 (July 1996), defined Plane 1 (0xFFFF-0x10FFFF)  (fills 5 more bits: up to 21 bits),
                  Unicode 3.1 (March 2001) defined 17 Planes.

                  Not All Planes are full. So not all 'Code points' have a real symbol associated.
                  These Planes are first created from empty 'blocks' (usually divisible by 16)
                  Empty elements are left for future extensions.
                  Sometimes the future extensions need more than the available-empty elements
                  so they go in a not adjacent block.
                  To manage this the

                             . Script
                             . Script_Extensions  (later)

                  properties were added.


   PROPERTIES:    Unicode also defines various properties for the characters

                  . "uppercase"
                  . "lowercase"
                  . "decimal digit"
                  . "punctuation"
                  . ...


   LOGICAL CHARACTERS:  A Unicode "logical" char is a sequence.
                  There are different kinds of sequence:

                  . combining character sequence:  in this case the logical char is
                          base character (like LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A ) followed by 1 or + modifiers (like COMBINING ACUTE ACCENT ).

                          [LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A] - [COMBINING ACUTE ACCENT]
                                   1                           2


                  . extended grapheme cluster:
                          a Korean Hangul syllable is considered for example
                          [a leading consonant] -  followed by an   [interior vowel]  -  followed by a [trailing consonant]
                                   1                                       2                                   3

                  The sequence idea, allows to build/code for many chars
                  without requiring to give Code Points (numbers) to all the symbols.



   PRECOMPOSED CHARACTERS:  only available for some combinations, they 'merge'
                  a sequence into a standalone char
                  Ex.
                  [LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A] -  [COMBINING ACUTE ACCENT] ---->  [LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A WITH ACUTE]
                   --------------------------------------------------         ----------------------------------
                                      NFD                                                   NFC

                  For a PRECOMPOSED CHARACTER, the single char is called "Normalization Form Composed" (abbreviated NFC)
                  while the original sequnece is called  "Normalization Form Decomposed" (NFD))



   UTF-8:
                  Code points are just abstract numbers.
                  To input and output these abstract numbers, the numbers must be encoded or serialised somehow.

                  Unicode defines several character encoding forms,
                  of which UTF-8 is the most popular.

                  UTF-8 is a variable length encoding that encodes characters as 1 to 4 bytes.
                   (UTF-8 is byte-order independent).

                  UTF-16 and UTF-32 are alternatives, but they are byte-order dependent
                  so there are the 2 variantes big- and little-endian

                  The ISO/IEC 10646 defines the UCS-2 and UCS-4 encoding forms.

   PERL SUPPORT FOR UNICODE:
                 . 5.6   starts but even with 5.6.1 fixes is still not the best
                 . 5.8   is the real first almost stable
                 . 5.14  good improvements
                 . 5.16  some fixes for 'quotemeta EXPR'
                 . 5.26  some fixes for 'range' operator
                 . 5.28  some fixes for 'split'

                 use feature 'unicode_strings'      # use this   not    use utf8

                 use 5.012 (or higher) is also ok for Unicode

                 All features that combine Unicode and I/O also require using the new PerlIO feature.
                 Almost all Perl 5.8 platforms are ok.

------------------------------------------------------------------
The Encode module provides the interface between Perl strings and the rest of the system. Perl strings are sequences of characters.

The repertoire of characters that Perl can represent is a superset of those defined by the Unicode Consortium. On most platforms the ordinal values of a character as returned by ord(S)
is the Unicode codepoint for that character.

     perl -e '$s=" ";      print ord($s)'      32     same ASCII
     perl -e '$s="A";      print ord($s)'      65     same ASCII
     perl -e '$s="AB";     print ord($s)'      65      "     "    (note gives the code point of the 1st char of the string)
     perl -e '$s="ABC";    print ord($s)'      65      "     "      "                  "                       "
     perl -e '$s="1";      print ord($s)'      49      "     "      "                  "                       "
     perl -e '$s="12";     print ord($s)'      49      "     "      "                  "                       "
     perl -e '$s="123458"; print ord($s)'      49      "     "      "                  "                       "

    TL;DR
           - use Encode qw(encode decode);
             use Encode;


             ex. 1   $foo  = decode('UTF-8', get 'http://example.com/');  # decode receiving input into a CHARACTER or TEXT string
                     length $foo                                          # num of CHARACTERS

                     so is:   a-received-byte-sequence-encoded-in-UTF8 ----> is loaded into a Unicode-perl-internal scalar-string


             ex. 2   $body = encode('UTF-8', $body);                      # encode sending output
                     $byte_count = length $body                           # num of BYTES

                     so is:   a Unicode-perl-internal scaalar-string ----> is encoded into a-byte-sequence-encoded-in-UTF8


                     I can use for example if sending as HTTP headers
                                    "Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8",
                                    "Content-Length: $byte_count"



           - utf8::encode(my $utf8_byte_string = $string);                # If performance is needed and
                                                                          # only interested in the UTF-8 representation:

             $octets = encode("iso-8859-1", $string);

                                 the UTF8 flag for $octets is always off.
                                 When you encode anything, the UTF8 flag on the result is always off, even
                                 when it contains a completely valid UTF-8 string.


           - use Encode qw(from_to);
             from_to($string, 'FOO', 'BAR');  # from_to func in Encode module, allows converting from 1 format to another
                                                in 1 instruct. instead of the 2:
                                                             my $text_string = decode('FOO', $foo_string);
                                                             my $bar_string  = encode('BAR', $text_string);


           - decode_utf8
             encode_utf8                   aliases for decode('utf8', ...)
                                                       encode('utf8', ...) .

                                           Note they are different from the preferred
                                                       decode('UTF-8', ...)
                                                       encode('UTF-8', ...) ;




    ---------------------



   . difference between bytes and characters
   . there are many different character sets
   . there are many different character sets - encodings

   . Unicode is encoded using several competing encodings, of which UTF-8 is the most used.
   . UTF-8 treats the first 128 codepoints, 0..127, the same as ASCII (so 1 byte per character.)
     All other characters are encoded as 2 to 4 bytes using a complex scheme.


   . Perl handles this for us, so we don't have to worry about this.





        - TEXT STRINGS (or CHARACTER STRINGS)
          They are the default strings. They are intended as  CHARACTER strings
                                 * Bytes are irrelevant here
                                 * and so are encodings

              Each character is just that: the character.

              The value of a character (ord, chr) is the corresponding Unicode code point.

                       ord EXPR   Returns the numeric value of the first character of EXPR.
                                  If EXPR is an empty string, returns 0. If EXPR is omitted, uses $_


                       chr NUMBER Returns the character represented by that NUMBER in the character set.
                                  For example, chr(65) is "A" in either ASCII or Unicode, and
                                               chr(0x263a) is a Unicode smiley face.

                                  Negative values give the Unicode replacement character (chr(0xfffd)),
                                  except under the bytes pragma, where the low eight bits of the value
                                  (truncated to an integer) are used.

                                  If NUMBER is omitted, uses $_ .

                                  Characters from 128 to 255 (inclusive) are by default internally
                                  not encoded as UTF-8 for backward compatibility reasons.


                       here s1 and s2 are eq:
                     ________________________________________________________
                    | @codepoints = map ord($_), split //, $s1;
                    | $s2 = join '', map chr($_), @codepoints;
                    '________________________________________________________
              perl -e 'use utf8; $s1="£€"; @c = map ord($_), split //, $s1; $s2 = join "", map chr($_), @c; print "[$s1]\n[$s2]\n";'






        - BINARY STRINGS (or BYTE STRINGS)
          They are made of bytes. Here, you don't have characters, just bytes.
          All communication with the outside world (anything outside of your current Perl process) is done in binary.

          ex.   my (@length_content) = unpack "(V/a)*", $binary;






        -  Encoding

           Is the conversion from text to binary.
           To encode, you have to supply the target encoding, for example iso-8859-1 or UTF-8 .
           Some encodings, like the iso-8859 ("latin") range, do not support the full Unicode standard;
           Characters that can't be represented are lost in the conversion.


        -  Decoding

           Is the conversion from binary to text.
           To decode, you have to know what encoding was used during the encoding phase.
           And most of all, it must be something decodable. It doesn't make much sense to decode
           a PNG image into a text string.


        -  Perl Internal format

           Perl has an internal format, an encoding that it uses to encode text strings so it can
           store them in memory. All text strings are in this internal format.
           In fact, text strings are never in any other format!

           You shouldn't worry about what this format is, because conversion is automatically done when
           you decode or encode.

           With no specified encoding layer, Perl tries to fit things into a single byte (ISO-8859-1 = ASCII)
           When it can't, it emits this warning and uses UTF-8 encoded data instead. Actually utf8 which is
           a superset of UTF-8 and Perl's more liberal way to deal with it.

           Every var stored has its own UTF8 flag, which says to Perl if it is UTF-8 or ASCII

        Perl v5.6.0, Starts to add the capacity to handle Unicode natively.
        Perl v5.6.1  fixed many problems but regular expressions still do not work.
        Perl v5.8.0, First recommended release for serious Unicode work.
        Perl v5.14.0 First release where Unicode support is (almost) seamlessly integrable without some gotchas.
        Perl v5.26.0 some fixes in the range operator
        Perl v5.28.0 some fixes in split

utf-8-strict    or   UTF-8 is the official standard
utf8                 it's a superset of UTF-8. It's Perl's way of being liberal in what it accepts.
viscii

      Note that they are:
              . case insensitive
              . "_" are treated as "-"

      find_encoding("UTF-8")->name # is 'utf-8-strict'
      find_encoding("utf-8")->name # ditto. names are case insensitive
      find_encoding("utf_8")->name # ditto. "_" are treated as "-"
      find_encoding("UTF8")->name  # is 'utf8'.


      SO BE VERY AWARE TO NOT FORGET THE "-" IN UTF-8 OR IT WILL BECOME THE LAX PERL's utf8



       -  binmode $fh     # To manage binary data, (like images)
                           needed because otherwise Perl may convert line endings on Win32 systems.



       -  binary string used together with a text string without explicit decoding:
          Perl assumes the binary string was encoded with ISO-8859-1 (known as latin-1).
          This implicit decoding (known as "upgrading") may sound positive, but it's best to avoid it.

       -  To store a text string, Perl sticks to 8 bit encoding as long as it can.
          When it has to give that up because other characters are added to the text string,
          it silently upgrades the string to UTF-8.

       -  utf8::upgrade($string)         # to force encoding to UTF-8.
                                           This can be used safely on any string,
                                           as it checks and does not change strings that have already been upgraded.

       -  "Wide character in print at example.pl line 2."

          a warning when I don't encode explicitly a text string.
          With no specified encoding layer, Perl tries to fit things into a single byte.
          When it can't, it emits this warning and uses utf8 (Perl liberal superset of UTF-8) encoded data instead.
          Perl will stream out its internal format (usually UTF8 so it could work
          but relying on this could also cause weird bugs)




       -  open my $fh, '<:encoding(UTF-8)', $filename;  # auto decoding on read
          open my $fh, '>:encoding(UTF-8)', $filename;  # auto encoding on write


          binmode $fh, ':encoding(UTF-8)';              # if file handle already opened


          They tell the PerlIO system to automatically decode everything, with the encoding layer.
          This way all streamings in/out through that filehandle will be encoded/decoded
          automatically


       -  use utf8;                  # to use Unicode in my Perl sources (eg. variables/function names ...)

       -  use bytes                  # is usually a failed attempt to do something useful. Just forget about it.

       -
------------------------------------------------------------------ use bytes



        use bytes;

        ... chr(...);       # or bytes::chr
        ... index(...);     # or bytes::index
        ... length(...);    # or bytes::length
        ... ord(...);       # or bytes::ord
        ... rindex(...);    # or bytes::rindex
        ... substr(...);    # or bytes::substr

        no bytes;           #  reverse the effect of use bytes within the current lexical scope.


        It allows non-destructively examine characters' individual bytes.
        Just insert this pragma temporarily, and remove it after the debugging is finished.


        $x = chr(400);     # Perl stores it in utf8
        length $x;         # is 1 (CHARACTER)
        use bytes          # set Perl to consider var stored as binary values (seq. of BYTES)
        length $x;         # is now 2 (BYTES)




        bytes::length()    is admittedly handy if you need to know the byte length of a Perl scalar.
                           But a more modern way is:

        use Encode 'encode';
        length(encode('UTF-8', $scalar))
------------------------------------------------------------------ use utf8

        use utf8;     # it tells Perl that the source code since then must be considered UTF-8 and not ASCII
                        Bytes in the source text that are not in the ASCII character set, will then be treated
                        as being part of a literal UTF-8 sequence.

        no utf8;      # go back to ASCII


        --------------------
        The following are functions in utf8:: module.
        NOTE:   You do not need to say use utf8 to use these and in fact you should not say that unless
                you really want to have UTF-8 source code.
        --------------------


        utf8::upgrade($string)     # TEXT-ASCII -->  TEXT-UTF-8  (no change if already UTF-8)
                                   # It's a change-in-place so the var memory is modified if not already UTF-8
                                   # Returns the number of BYTES necessary to represent the string as UTF-8.



        $success = utf8::downgrade($string[, $fail_ok]) # (Since Perl v5.8.0) TEXT-UTF-8 --> TEXT-ASCII  (no change if already ASCII)

                                                        # Returns true on success.
                                                        # dies on Fail (conversion not possible).
                                                        # Return false (instead of dying) on Fail + I specified $fail_ok true
                                                          ex. utf8::downgrade($string, 1) or die "string must be octets";
