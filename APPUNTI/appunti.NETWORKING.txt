                   NAT
---------------------------------------------

         1. Network ADDRESS Transaltion
         2. The ADDRESSES are IPs  (Source and/or Destination)
         3. In the communication:

                       Me ------>   S1 -----> S2 ......      www.xxxx.com

            between Me and www.xxxx.com
            Many servers are passed. Some of these can act NAT
            changing the Source/Destination IP in one direction and
            changing back when the answer comes back.

            The reason are mainly:

            1. Many computers connecting through the same exiting S1.

               All computers have many != IPs, while S1 has 1 in output.
               So S1 will take care of transforming in 1 direction and reassemble when back.

               We can think of this NAT as 'SNAT' (changing SOURCE)
               as I allow more SOURCE host to go out.

               SNAT is done BEFORE pkts go out onto the wire.


            2. Multiple Servers behind the same S1.
               In these cases still Many Servers with != IPs are behind 1 S1,
               and it's single incoming public IP.

               S1 will redirect the incoming requests to the proper Server
               according to any kind of logic (ex. 1 Web server, 1 FTP server ...)

               This type of NAT is also referred as   'PORT FORWARDING'
               if I want to highlight that the logic to distinguish the
               service to forward to is based on the port.

            3. S1 is acting as a PROXY, so implementing a layer of transparency
               to the HOST behing it.


            2 & 3 are both examles of DNAT (changing DESTINATION) as they
            act the change AFTER the pkts come off the wire.
