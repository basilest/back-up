==================================================  AD
   AD : Active Directoty    (Microsoft proprietary directory service, running on Windows Server)

        .  It's like a DNS, I can query it to have information (ex. location)

        .  It's this tree structure :

                 Root directory
                      |
                      |________
                               |
                               |
                            Countries
                               |________
                                        |
                                        |
                                  Organisations
                                        |________
                                                 |
                                                 |
                                        Organisational Units
                                                 |________
                                                          |
                                                          |
                                               Individuals  (info about people, printers, files, ...)

             so for example I can query individual="John" in Country="America" and
             I receive back many individuals. I can then narrow down to in the end grab i.e. his email address.




==================================================  Services in AD

      AD provides its taks via its main services:


      1. AD DS   =  (Acrive Directory) DOMAIN Service

                    . it's the MAIN service.
                    . it runs on a server which is called "domain controller"
                    . it stores dir info and manages the users' access


      2. AD LDS = LIGHTWEIGHT DIR Services

                    . like AD DS but can run in multiple instances on one server
                    . It manages data via LDAP

      3. LDAP   = LIGHTWEIGHT DIR ACCESS Protocol   it's a protocol (application level)
      4. AD CS  = CERTIFICATE     Services  to handle certificates/ keys
      5. AD FS  = FEDERATION      Services  it manages SSO  (to login once)
      6. AD RMS = RIGHTS MANAGEM. Services  it encrypts info (eg. email) to limit access
