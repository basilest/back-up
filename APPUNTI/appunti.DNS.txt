      HOST NAME  = [DOMAIN NAME] with 1 or more associated [IP addresses]



      DNS PROPAGATION           refers to the time for any DNS changes to transmit across the Internet.
                                1 DNS changes can take up to 24-48 hours to fully propagate.


      RECORDS :


       "A" Record              "Address record":
                               gives the IP address of a domain.
                               It maps a hostname to a 32-bit IPv4 address.
                               users that try to go to www.example.com will get the right IP address.
                               maps a hostname to a 32-bit IPv4 address.
                               It takes this format (example):

                                        Name             TTL     TYPE    DATA
                                        ftp.domain.com   43200   A       IP Address
                               or:

                                        Name             TTL     TYPE    DATA
                                        *.domain.com     43200   A       10.0.2.2

                               The '*' allows to match multiple domain names to have the same IP
                               This way, if someone mistakenly types subdomains of domain.com
                               he will still get domain.com



      MX Record:               "Mail Exchange Record":
                                       maps      [Domain name] <-- --> to a list of mail exchange servers.
                               A zone can have 1 or + (MX) records  (each MX Rec defined with a different priority -
                               If mail can't be delivered using the highest priority record, the second priority record is used,
                               and so on.)
                               These records point to hosts that accept mail messages on behalf of the host.
                               A host can be a 'MX' for itself.
                               MX records need to not point to a host in the same zone.
                               A 'MX' record takes this format:

                                         host.domain.name       IN     MX      10 otherhost.domain.name.
                                                                IN     MX      20 otherhost2.domain.name.

                              'MX' : preference numbers (0 - 65535) to assign who is selected first
                              (lower numbers: higher priority)




      PTR Record:             "Pointer Record":
                                       maps      [IPv4 addr.] <-- --> to the canonical name for that host
                              It implements reverse DNS lookup for that address.
                              For example, www.icann.net has the IP address 192.0.34.164,
                              but a PTR record maps 164.34.0.192.in-addr.arpa to its canonical name.



      NS Record               "Name Server Record"
                                       maps      [Domain name.] <-- --> to a list of DNS servers authoritative for that domain

                                       ex:
                                          ns1.mediatemple.net
                                          ns2.mediatemple.net



      SOA Record              "Start of Authority Record"
                              Specifies the DNS server providing information about
                                         an Internet domain,
                                         the email of the domain administrator,
                                         the domain serial number,
                                         several timers relating to refreshing the zone.



      TXT Record              TXT Record allows an admin to insert arbitrary text
                              into a DNS record.
                              ex:
                              "this record is used to implement the Sender Policy Framework and DomainKeys specifications."
