Origins are determined by the combination of
    . protocol (HTTP or HTTPS),
    . domain   (ex example.com)
    . port number    (if missing, then  80 is assumed for HTTP and 443 for HTTPS)


If any of these three elements is different between two resources,
they are considered to have different origins, and the same-origin policy applies.


web browsers inhibt a script loaded from one origin

    https://example.com

to access resources from

    https://anotherdomain.com





CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) headers are set on the server of the resource being accessed to allow such interaction.





Ex
    a resource from
    origin
            https://example.com     (which means   https://example.com:443 )
    cannot access for example
            https://example.com:81



The "same-origin policy" is then implemented in the browsers and cannot be relaxed via settings (ex Firefox)
The only way to play with it, is via CORS.

It's a very old feature, so even old browsers support it.
Old browsers might not have support for CORS, so for old browsers the
"same-origin policy" is even more strict and cannot be relaxed
