------------------------------------------------------ GET VIM

UPDATE VIM & PLUGIN
If you have an old VIM version, then do this
1.  download the zip new version from vim.org
2.  unpack 
3.  go to src dir
4.  edit Makefile uncommenting the line ‘prefix’ (a good vale could be “$HOME”)
5.  make (to compile)
6.  make install to have it in $HOME/bin
To install Vundle follow the instruction of Vundle GitHub repo/README. Anyhow they could not work 
if linking at ~/.vim/bundle/ as written in the instructions.
A workaround is:
1.  link to ~/.vim/plugin/:
git clone https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim.git ~/.vim/plugin/Vundle.vim
also in .vimrc link to ~/.vim/plugin/:    set rtp+=~/.vim/plugin/Vundle.vim/
2.  execute from vi   :PluginInstall!, this will create again Vundle.vim but in ~/.vim/bundle/ and it is working, so you can rm -rf ~/.vim/plugin
3.  Add all the required plugin

------------------------------------------------------ buffer

               The are 9 DELETION (& YANKING)  BUFFERS for 'LINES' <----------- !!!!!!
               Words, or a portion of a line, are not saved in a buffer

               ex   "3p   :    print the content of buffer 3

               So remember that DELETE (d) and YANK (y) use the same buffer

"1pu.u.u ecc   to see all the buffers one after the other and found the right one

               The 9 buffers are said 'unnamed'.
               Using letters the buffers become other 26  (named buffers)
               Capital letters are not other 26 buffers, but they are used to
               'append' to what is already present in buffer 'lowercase'

               "d7yy    copy 7 linex to buffer named d
               "D0      append in buffer d from cursor back to start of line

:map ...  oooo             ... can be a symbol (ex -) or specail char (<space> <c-d> for control d)
                           ooo can be anythig  ex. :map <space> viw   (select a word pressing space)

          ex :map <F2> i bla bla bla <ESC>  :r date "+\%x" <ESC> kJ

          :vmap       visual                :vmap \ U      UPPERCASE the selection when pressing \
          :imap       insert                :imap <c-d> <esc>ddi  delete a line when pressing Ctrl-C
                                                                  N.B. with esc I exit 'insert' and go to 'normal'
                                                                       withoud esc I would have 2 char 'd written

          N.B. the opposite:  unmap       :unmap <space>
                             nunmap       
                             vunmap       :vunmap \
                             iunmap


          One downside of the *map commands is the danger of recursing:  
                     :nmap dd O<esc>jddk     <--- here the second dd enter an infinte loop

          SO TO AVOID RECURSION TROUBLE, ABOVE ALL IT COULD HAPPEN WHEN INSTALLING PLUGINS
          N E V E R  USE THE *MAP VERSIONS. ALWAYS USE THE 'NO'-'RE'CURSION VERSION: 'NORE'

                         noremap
                        nnoremap
                        vnoremap
                        inoremap

          To avodi to shadow a key with map, just choose only 1 key for all my mappings,
          and always use it plus others (ex. '-'  :nnoremap -d dd   :nnoremap -c 0Di)
          Vim calls it <leader> and  you can set it, and then refer to it, like the following:

                 :let mapleader = ","
                 :nnoremap <leader>d dd

                 :nnoremap <leader>ev :split  $MYVIMRC<cr>     now 'ev carriage-retun (ENTER) open .vimrc
                 :nnoremap <leader>sv :source $MYVIMRC<cr>     to make changes in .vimrc active sourcing it

          There is also a <localleader>  that 'lives' only inside its file (ex. .html, .java, .txt)

                 :let maplocalleader = "\\"

 <buffer>      :nnoremap <buffer> <leader>x dd    <buffer> keyword means that the mapping acts only 
                                                  in this file. If I change file (buffer) it's not present.

               N.B. A local mapping hides more general ones 
                    (ex. :nnoremap  Q dd 
                         :nnoremap <buffer> Q x <--- this hides the above)

 :setlocal     Set only in that buffer. So in another files I can set that var in other ways
               (ex. in 1 file, :setlocal nu     in a 2nd file  :setlocal nonu)
               N.B. Not all the var has a setlocal possibility





:iabbrev ... ooo                    I can set an alias that when in insert mode, as soon as I type the word
                                    ... vim on the fly changes it to ooo.
                                    It's not exactly like map with 'inoremap' as with inoremap that change
                                    would occur as soon as the sequence ... occurs. While with iabbrev
                                    the change occurs only if ... is a detached word.

                                    ex. :iabbrev @@  basile.stef@gmail.com 

                                    with <buffer> it's local to the buffer when I run the cmd

autocommand:       With this feature vim can execute command when some events occurs, addressing for ex.
                   also the filetype o whatever else.

                   The general form is:

                       :autocmd BufNewFile * :write
                                ^          ^ ^
                                |          | |
                                |          | The command to run.
                                |          |
                                |          A "pattern" to filter the event.
                                |
                                The "event" to watch for.

                    . :help autocmd-events     list all possible events.
                    . ex:

                           javascript and python

                           :autocmd FileType javascript nnoremap <buffer> <localleader>c I//<esc>
                           :autocmd FileType python     nnoremap <buffer> <localleader>c I#<esc>

                           :filetype :filet  on  activate vim to detect filetype

                    :augroup / autocmd!
                           The problem with autcommands is that if I gave the same n-times (just
                           sourcing .vimrc n-times) vim has n autoc. equals, executing each n-times.
                           The soltion is in 2 steps.
                              1st step:
                              as name-scoping, include each autoc. in a block:

                              :augroup xxxxxx            xxxxx is a name I choose for this group of cmd
                              :   autocmd .....          here put all my autcmd  
                       (1)    :   autocmd .....
                              :augroup END

                              the 2nd step is init the block with the autocmd!  (to clear this block)
                       (2)    :augroup xxxxxx            
                              :   autocmd!   <-------- 
                              :   autocmd .....
                              :augroup END

                              without autocmd! if I would written again the same block (1) I would have it
                              double size, having all the cmd repeated.




           (number)(command)(text)      <----- text is a MOVEMENT command
                                               think that power on a command like
                                               y?stefano     copy from cursor, back to 1st occurrence of 'stefano'
                                               dn            delete up to next search  !!!!!!!!

 operator-pending      I can map a movement to some keys so that when I type a command ex. c
   (:onoremap)         and my mapped sequence than the effect is to have the command operating on my selection

                       The block of text on which vim will operate is:
                          
                          1. if I used VISUAL to define a selection it will operate on that
                          2. otherwise FROM where is the cursor (START point) till where I stop moving (END point)

                       So the visual way 1. allows to chose a different START than where is the cursor

                       ex.  :onoremap p i(       dp will then delete text inside (
                            :onoremap p 4w       cp will then change from where I am till 4 words ahead
                            :onoremap p vw       dp will then delete the following word (having selected with 'v')
                            :onoremap in( :<c-u>normal! f(vi(<cr>
                                            ^     ^      ^^ ^  ^

----------------------------------------------- Variables

             M Y     V a r               V I M    O p t i o n s   (&)

             :let foo = "bar"        |   :set nowrap
             :echo foo               |   :echo &wrap  --> 0  N.B. '&' so VIM access its option instead of
                                     |                       a possible my var with the same name
             :let foo = 42           |   
             :echo foo               |   :set wrap
                                     |   :echo &wrap  --> 1 


             N.B.  Vim Options can be then also set with 'let'  :let &textwidth = 100
                   It's not visible, this new power from there 
                   (as you could have used the shorter :set textwidth = 100)
                   but you can see when relying on power of var-usage as: 
                                                       :let &textwidth = &textwidth + 10

                   let &wrap = 0            ok = 0
                   let &wrap = 1            ok = 1
                   let &wrap = 458          ok = 1
                   let &wrap = "0"          ok = 0
                   let &wrap = "1"          ok = 1
                   let &wrap = "56"         ok = 1
                   let &wrap = "56adf"      ok = 1
                   let &wrap = "a56"               NOT OK
                   let &wrap = "etyqwy"            NOT OK

                   The above example depicts like VIM manage Strings
                   "Evfmmmf"  is not considered TRUE (or 1) so neither "a10". They are both FALSE or 0
                   while "1"   "1a"  "342shdfhs"    are all TRUE

l:  b:          'l:' and 'b' prefix means local and   :let &l:xxx = ...      :let &b:xxx = 
                  instead of                          :let &xxx   = ...      :let &xxx   =
                  set var xxx only for that buffer  
                  There are other char besides 'l' and 'b' to define the 'scope' of a var:   :help internal-variables

@             registers can be reference as variables the syntax is:

              echo @a       echo register a
              echo @"       echo default unnamed reg. (called ") where y and d text goes
              echo @/       echo the text stored in the last find (so the current if a write 'n'

              :let @a = "hello!"   "move text in register a"

                           SO IT'S DANGEROUS USE == AS YOUR PLUGIN WOULD NOT WORK EVERYWHERE
                           DEPENDING OF RUNNING VIM SETTINGS (:set ignorecase)

                                           here we have literally \n\\
                                           The ONLY exception is ' itself:

                                           :echom 'That''s enough.' --> That's enough


Managing Strings
                      :echom strlen("foo")                3
                      :echom    len("foo"                 3
                      :echo split("one two three")        splits a String (default separator is <space>)into a 'List'
                      :echo split("one,two,three", ",")   specify a separator (,)
                      :echo join(["foo", "bar"], "...")   foo...bar
                      :echo join(split("foo bar"), ";")   foo;bar
                      :echom tolower("Foo")
                      :echom toupper("Foo")
