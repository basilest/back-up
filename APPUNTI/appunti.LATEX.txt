   TEX       is a typesetting program by
                       Donald Knuth,
             originally designed for mathematical and scientific docs


   LATEX     a more extensive macro set by
                       Leslie Lamport

   Today a LATEX doc uses a set of macros and packages developed by
                       a multitude of others after Lamport’s work.




Install on a Mac:    MacTeX    (MacTeX.pkg)
                     https://www.tug.org/mactex/mactex-download.html
                      (massive install package  5.2 GB in 2023
                       which is the full version (recommended even for beginners)
                       containing all the languages (Chinese ...)
                       and the most used packages)


                     Once installed (~ 10 min) the taken size is 8.5 GB






SPACES                1 space = blanks | tabs
                      Several consecutive whitespace characters are treated as
                      1 “space".

PARAGRAPH             1 blank-line defines end of PARAGRAPHs

SPECIAL CHARS         # $ % ^ & _ { } ~ \
                      as they have special meaning to insert them, they must be escaped
                      with \   ex \#

\textbackslash        to escape \  (it's not used \\. \\ forces a new-line)

\COMMANDS             - LateX commands start with a \
                      - are CASE SENSITIVE
                      - are formed by {letters} only
                      - so they end at 1st non-letter char {ex space or numbers...}
                      - args: after the command name, some parameters may follow
                              {} to enclose MANDATORY args
                              []       "    OPTIONAL  args

GENERAL DOC STRUCTURE                     ______________
                       \documentclass{...}                 PREAMBLE
                       \usepackage{...} _________________
                       \begin{document}
                           ..                              BODY

                           ..                              anything following is ignored

COMPILATION            1. write the doc in a file A.tex
                       2. compile it as "latex A.tex"  (which generates A.dvi)
                                                       Device Independent
                       3. see on screen as "xdvi A.dvi &"
                          xdvi works only on Unix with X11
                          on windows it can be used "yap" (yet another previewer)
                       4. transform to postscript:
                          dvips -Pcmz A.dvi -o A.ps
                       5. transform to pdf:
                          dvipdf A.dvi

Doc CLASSES
                       article    for articles in scientific journals, presentations,
                                  short reports, program documentation, invitations, . . .
                       proc       a class for proceedings based on the article class.
                       minimal    is as small as it can get. It only sets a page size and
                                  a base font. It is mainly used for debugging purposes.
                       report     for longer reports containing several chapters,
                                  small books, PhD theses, . . .
                       book       for real books
                       slides     for slides. The class uses big sans serif letters.
                                  You might want to consider using the Beamer class instead

                       they define the 'scope' where some settings apply

                       RULE: the env 'document' must be the 1st & encapsulating all the others

                                    \begin{document}
                                      \begin{environment1}

PREAMBLE               It's the section OUT of any env,
                       so before the \begin{document}

                                                           are in the preamble


PACKAGES               to enhance the capabilities of LateX
                       (ex. graphics, coloured text)
                       It's possible  to write your own extensions

PAGE style             \pagestyle{ style }
                                  - plain      page num on the bottom (in the middle of the footer).
                                               This is the default page style.
                                  - headings   page num in the header
                                  - empty      header / footer empty

                       \thispagestyle{ style } change only for the current page

PAGE NUM               \pagenumbering{arabic}   1 2   3  4
                       \pagenumbering{roman}    I II III IV
                       \pagenumbering{gobble}   skip  (ex useful at first cover page)

INCLUDE                To split a big project in more files
                       \include{ filename }   include a file in a new page
                       \input{ filename }     like \include but not in a new page
                       \includeonly{ filename, filename, ...}  if added in the preamble limits
                                              the range of subsequent \include
                                              to only these listed files

\usepackage{syntonly}  to only check consistency for the doc (pre-processing) without
\syntaxonly            a complete compilation (no .dvi is generated).
                       To save time. When ready comment out the 2' line

line/page breaks       \\ or \newline    forces a new line
                       \newpage          forces a new page
                       ~                 a space to not enlarge (ex in Fig. 5
                                         after the . LateX enlarges the space
                                         as it thinks a new sentence it's starting.
                                         To inhibit that, write Fig.~5)
                       \@                To enlarge a space. (ex I like BASIC.
                                         '.' after an UpperCase (here C) is not
                                         considered end of sentence, to say it is,
                                         write I like BASIC.\@)


\linebreak[n] \nolinebreak[n] \pagebreak[n] \nopagebreak[n]
                       ask to break or nobreak (a line or a page) at the point where the
                       command is issued.
                       The optional n from 0 to 4 makes the request more o less strong
                       4 is strongest.

-                      there are 4 types of -
                          .hyphen        a single - (insert it writing -)
                          .en-dash       a longer - (insert it, writing --)
                          .em-dash       an even longer - (insert it writing ---)
                          .minus sign    the minus for numbers (insert it writing $-$)

\mbox{ text }          to force 'text' to stay on the same line (ex. a phone num)

FLOATING            Tables and figures are not cut on more pages.
                    Anyhow to avoid too much empty page sections, they remain in a FIFO
                    queue of floating parts. As soon as there is space they are printed.

                    \begin{figure} [spec]  ex [!tbp]  t top of page

                                                        if it cannot process this float.
                    \clearpage     says to LaTeX to empty 'here' all he floating queue (so probably at the
                                   start of the next page) \cleardoublepage (at the first right page)

\caption [short] {text}    for figure and tables (add a number and the text Figure. Table.)
                    The optional [short] text is what is passed to build \listoffigures
                    \listoftables if the {text} is too long.
