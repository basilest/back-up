DevOps  (from Agile)
It aims to have an environment where
          building,
          testing,
          releasing software,
can happen
          rapidly,
          frequently,
          more reliably.

DevOps refers to the  Continuous Delivery concept:
small and quick changes (focused on the end customer, going live, or quick time to market).



Here they are most of the
OpenSource tools used (DevOps toolchain):
__________________________________
 1. (SCM) - Source Code Management

     - GIT:
         - GitHub:     NOT free for private repos.
         - Git server: can be setup on-premise for free.

     - CodeCommit: from AWS



__________________________________
 2. BUG Tracking
    - Bugzilla                : mainly for BUGS,
                               but is feature rich to do other SW devel. phases
                               even IT ticketing system
    - JIRA       - (Altassian): for BUGS / Story
    - Confluence - (Altassian); for collaborative documentation



__________________________________
 3. Collaborative Docs
    - MediaWiki  - out of the box features are limited
                   but there are plenty of third-party extensions.



__________________________________
 4. Continuous Integration
    - Jenkins - (CloudBees) - many free plugins



__________________________________
 5. Artifacts Management
    - A lot of companies might not have it in their DevOps stack

    Artifactory - stores built artifacts and
                - caches third-party tools.
                - So it retrieves/upload proper versions
                  for meeting build dependencies   (like Jenkins)
                - Distributes packages for deployments.


__________________________________
 6. Configuration Management (and Orchestration)
    - Ansible - agentless
              - can Configure & Deploy with no additional tool
              - advanced handling of host inventory (dynamic generation of inventory lists)
              - supports Python (more common than Ruby)

    - Puppet  - Configure (requires additions for Deployment)
              - Ruby

    - Chef    - Configure (requires additions for Deployment)
              - Ruby



__________________________________
 7. Monitoring
    - Nagios : lack of features out of the box
               but
                   - tons of plugins
                   - very easy to write your own


__________________________________
 8. Log Management
    - ELK : Elasticsearch, Logstash and Kibana stack

            Elastichsearch:
                            - based on
                              'Lucene' (Free Apache software Licence)
                                 full text indexing and searching capability
                                 (widely used in the implementation of Internet search engines)
                                  Twitter uses 'Lucene'
                                 also for local/ singles-site searching.
                                 Not contains crawling and HTML parsing functionality

                            - extends 'Lucene' for crawling and HTML parsing functionality

                            https://github.com/companieshouse/chl-database/pull/59








_________________________ ( 4- Continuous Integration)   JENKINS

        - written in Java
        - server based
        - runs in a servlet container (such as Apache Tomcat)
        - supports SCM tools (ex. Git, Clearcase, ...)
        - can compile (Ant, Maven)
        - can run shell scripts.
        - Builds can be triggered in many ways (ex by Git commit, cron tab, specific url ...)
        - Builds can generate test reports in various formats
          supported by plugins (JUnit support is currently bundled)


_________________________ ( 6- Config. Manag)   ANSIBLE  (1.9)

        Ansible is a free SW platform for configuring and managing computers (nodes)
        over SSH or PowerShell and requires Python (2.4 or later) to be installed on them.

        Modules work over JSON and standard output and can be written in any programming language.

        The system uses YAML to express reusable descriptions of systems.

        It is included as part of the Fedora distribution of Linux, owned by Red Hat inc.,
        and is also available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux, CentOS, and
        Scientific Linux via Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux (EPEL)
        as well as other operating systems.

        Ansible is commercially supported and sponsored by Ansible, Inc.
        On 16 October, 2015, Red Hat Inc. announced that it had signed a definitive agreement to acquire Ansible, Inc.

        It was named "Ansible" after the fictional instantaneous hyperspace communication system featured in Orson Scott Card's Ender's Game,
        and originally invented by Ursula K. Le Guin for her 1966 novel Rocannon's World.

1. brew install ansible

_________________________ 2   VAGRANT  (1.6.4 or better)  build

        Vagrant creates and configures VMs.
        It can be seen as a higher-level wrapper around VirtualBox, VMware, KVM and Linux Containers (LXC),
        and around configuration management software such as Ansible, Chef, Salt, and Puppet.

        Vagrant was originally tied to VirtualBox, but version 1.1 added support for others
        such as VMware and KVM, and for server environments like Amazon EC2.

        Vagrant is written in Ruby, but can be used in projects written in other languages
        such as PHP, Python, Java, C# and JavaScript.

        Since version 1.6, Vagrant natively supports Docker containers,
        which in some cases can serve as a substitute for a fully VMs

        Vagrant plugins also exist, including
           vagrant-libvirt that adds support for libvirt,
           vagrant-lxc     that adds support for lxc,
           vagrant-vsphere that adds support for VMware's ESXi.
