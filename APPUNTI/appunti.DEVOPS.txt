DevOps  (from Agile)
It aims to have an environment where 
          building, 
          testing, 
          releasing software, 
can happen 
          rapidly, 
          frequently, 
          more reliably.

DevOps refers to the  Continuous Delivery concept:
small and quick changes (focused on the end customer, going live, or quick time to market).



Here they are most of the 
OpenSource tools used (DevOps toolchain):
__________________________________
 1. (SCM) - Source Code Management

     - GIT: 
         - GitHub:     NOT free for private repos. 
         - Git server: can be setup on-premise for free. 

     - CodeCommit: from AWS

 2. BUG Tracking
    - Bugzilla                : mainly for BUGS, 
                               but is feature rich to do other SW devel. phases
                               even IT ticketing system
    - JIRA       - (Altassian): for BUGS / Story
    - Confluence - (Altassian); for collaborative documentation



__________________________________
 3. Collaborative Docs
    - MediaWiki  - out of the box features are limited
                   but there are plenty of third-party extensions.

 4. Continuous Integration
    - Jenkins - (CloudBees) - many free plugins

 5. Artifacts Management
    - A lot of companies might not have it in their DevOps stack

    Artifactory - stores built artifacts and 
                - caches third-party tools.
                - So it retrieves/upload proper versions
                  for meeting build dependencies   (like Jenkins)
                - Distributes packages for deployments.

 6. Configuration Management (and Orchestration)
    - Ansible - agentless
              - can Configure & Deploy with no additional tool
              - advanced handling of host inventory (dynamic generation of inventory lists)
              - supports Python (more common than Ruby)

    - Puppet  - Configure (requires additions for Deployment)
              - Ruby

    - Chef    - Configure (requires additions for Deployment)
              - Ruby

 7. Monitoring
    - Nagios : lack of features out of the box
               but 
                   - tons of plugins
                   - very easy to write your own

 8. Log Management
    - ELK : Elasticsearch, Logstash and Kibana stack

            Elastichsearch: 
                            - based on 
                              'Lucene' (Free Apache software Licence)
                                 full text indexing and searching capability
                                 (widely used in the implementation of Internet search engines)
                                  Twitter uses 'Lucene'
                                 also for local/ singles-site searching.
                                 Not contains crawling and HTML parsing functionality

                            - extends 'Lucene' for crawling and HTML parsing functionality
