 Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

    https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/csrf


    For most sites,
    browser REQUESTS
    automatically include any credentials associated with the site, such as
      . the userâ€™s session cookie,
      . IP address,
      . Windows domain credentials
      . ..



    FACTS
             -  all cookies, even the secret ones, are submitted with every REQUEST    --> All authentication tokens will be submitted
             -  HTTPS by itself does nothing to defend against CSRF.
                However, HTTPS should be considered a prerequisite for any preventative measures to be trustworthy.
